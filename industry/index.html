<div class="section">
    <div class="title">A platform to share and exchange ideas</div>
    <div class="content">Industry participants are expected to highlight problems which they are facing, particularly those that can
        be answered in the framework of mathematical and computational algorithms, partial differential
        equations (PDEs), mathematical simulation software and scientific computing. The industry participants
        need not to elaborate the problem as a mathematical model but a broad idea of the challenges they are
        facing so that the experts and researchers from academia can understand and try to provide an answer
        through a robust mathematical model and numerical algorithms using PDEs.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <div class="title">Specific topics relevant to the industry</div>
    <div class="content">The speakers (plenary, invited, exclusive and contributed talks) will broadly cover topics ranging in the

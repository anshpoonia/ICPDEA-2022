    <p class="content">The International Conference on Computational Partial Differential Equations and Applications (ICCPDEA-2022) is an
        international conference being organized by the BML Munjal University. The conference aims at
        bringing together leading researchers from academia, industry and laboratories world-wide working
        in the diverse field of partial differential equations (PDEs) and their applications to share results on
        all aspects of recent advances in partial differential equations for sharing knowledge and informal
        discussions. The overall goal of this conference is to promote research in mathematical and
        computational aspects of partial differential equations.<br>
        The ICCPDEA-2022 will also honor Prof. A.K. Pani (IIT Bombay) and Prof. Carsten Carstensan
        (Humboltz Universitat, Berlin) on the occasion of their 65th and 60th birthday respectively by a
        special session. We also expect many coauthors, coworkers, colleagues and friends of Prof. Pani and
        Prof. Carsten to take part in the conference. The conference will feature plenary, and invited talks
        from eminent researchers, practitioners and senior mathematicians and scientists from India and
        abroad. A number of contributed talks and posters by the young mathematicians will also be
        presented in the conference. Some basic information about the conference is given below. Further
        details will follow in the days to come.
        <br><br>
        The ICCPDEA-2022 will provide collaboration and exchange of research ideas in the interdisciplinary
        field of partial differential equations, their solutions using advanced computational methods and
        applications in a variety of fields of current and future research. The ICCPDEA-2022 will foster
        knowledge sharing, research &amp; skill enhancement among the participants.
